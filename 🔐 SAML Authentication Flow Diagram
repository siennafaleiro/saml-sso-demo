ðŸ’¬ Flow Explained:

Step | Description
1 | User attempts to access a protected resource on the Service Provider (SP).
2 | SP redirects the user to the Identity Provider's (IdP) SSO endpoint with a SAML request.
3 | The user logs in to the IdP (if not already authenticated).
4 | IdP responds with a SAML assertion, posted to the SP via the userâ€™s browser.
5 | SP validates the SAML response, extracts the user identity, and grants access.
