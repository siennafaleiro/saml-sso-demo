# saml-sso-demo
A simple SAML SSO demo application that showcases how to implement Single Sign-On (SSO) using the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol. Ideal for testing and understanding SAML-based authentication workflows.

Absolutely üí°! Implementing Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a crucial topic when studying for the [CompTIA Cloud+ (CV0-003)](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cloud) exam, especially around identity management, authentication, and secure cloud access. Let's break this down into a detailed technical guide with a GitHub-centric step-by-step workflow, so you can demonstrate SAML-based SSO using a sample app and an identity provider (IdP) like Okta or Azure AD.

**üîê SAML: High-Level Understanding (CompTIA Cloud+ Context)**

- SAML is an XML-based open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between Identity Providers (IdPs) and Service Providers (SPs).
- Cloud+ Exam Scope:
  - Understand federated identity management.
  - Secure APIs and services.
  - Handle authentication delegation across clouds.
 
**üß† Cloud+ Certification Tips (CV0-003)**

- Know how SAML offloads authentication to identity providers.
- Understand SSO architecture and benefits in cloud federated systems.
- Security: SAML uses X.509 certificates for signing/encryption.
